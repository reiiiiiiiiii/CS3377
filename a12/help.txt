username array
corresponding FILE* to write to that clients
 
int numClients = 0;
char usernames[MAXCLIENTS][MAXLENGTH];
FILE* clientfps[MAXCLIENTS];
 
server-child thread:
 
	get "send userName message"
	lookup userName in usernames[] array : strcmp()
	found at index 
	fprintf(clientfps[index], ....);
 
main()
	open wellknownfifo
	while 
		get clientfilename userName - you can use strtok()
		copy userName into usernames[numClients] : strcpy()
		clientfps[numClients] = fopen(clientfilename, "w");
		create child thread (numClients);
		numClients++;	



Client:
	in addition to client fifo, it should send username too.
